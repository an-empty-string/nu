# nu

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ohnx/nu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ohnx/nu)

nu is the next generation of [mu](https://github.com/ohnx/mu).

nu is a static site generator written in C and intended for fast and easy creation of a blog-style website from markdown files with low setup requirements (ie, ruby, python are not needed).

the goal for nu is to be a simpler version of something like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

with the help of some scripts, nu can even be run automagically when you push to a repository to create a static website.
