Great!\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Getting Started page](https://github.com/nu-dev/nu/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki.\r\n\r\nIt goes over installation and setup.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWant to contribute to nu? Great!\r\n\r\nHere are some ways to help out:\r\n\r\n - Use nu. By using nu, you'll be able to find issues that might not have been caught. If you come across an issue, take screenshots, attach files, and try to come up with steps to replicate the problem. Every bit of information helps!\r\n - Contribute themes! nu has a couple of [themes](https://github.com/nu-dev/themes) right now. Fork the repository and create your own themes, then create pull requests. The more themes and customization there is for nu, the more people may want to use it :wink:\r\n - Work on nu itself. If you're a C programmer (and even if you're not!), feel free to poke around nu's source code to try and fix [issues](https://github.com/nu-dev/nu/issues).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](https://github.com/nu-dev/nu/blob/master/LICENSE)",
